About me: "(officially verifiable)" Been coding since 1977 when I took a "BASIC" class as WTSU. WTSU students had access to the university DEC System 10 to complete assignments offered by the Business, Math and Science departments. My natural talent for programming Fortran IV quickly gained notarity among faculty after my two person team won 2nd in a inter-colligate on-site programming competition. The programming language for the event was decided by joint university facultities and was announced to competitors at the event. Soon I was offered course credit/publication citation by profs in the Math and Physics dept and because of my understanding and love of chemistry I was offered a graduate scholoarship and fellowship in Inorganic Chemisty in my sophmore or junior year.  After unniv I went on to program everything from eproms for 8088 based circuits to Automated Coordinate Measuring Machines, CNC equipment, Industrial Robots, IBM-286, 386,486 and Pentium based coomputers in both Dox and Windos (starting wuth Win 3.0 until present.) In the early 80's I also was programming on a HP UX mini using HP basic, and Commodore Vic20/64 for industrial purposes, and also started developing in IBM (MS) Dos based engineerong/science applications using Ashton-Tate dBaseIII and dBaseIY and Lotus 1-2-3. I'm still programming/designing for run in my retirement.
